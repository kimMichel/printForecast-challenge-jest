# printForecast-challenge-jest

This little challenge was a coding challenge from 'The complete Javascript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert' by `Jonas Schmedtmann`. 

Was my first challenge from this course and I added some Unit test to practice more TDD concepts using Jest.

In this challenge I have to search and practice using `jest spies` to test if was logging the correctly message from my function.
